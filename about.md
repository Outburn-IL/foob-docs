**Functionality:**  The solution supports various data types conversion to FHIR using pre-defined IRIS classes seamlessly integrated with FUME. The IRIS developer/integrator will be capable of building and adapting default solutions to the target workflow according to the business requirements.

**Simplicity:** Minimum Object Script coding needs by developing integration-ready components and automatic solution deployment using ZPM installer.

**Flexibility:** The solution can quickly adapt to any S2T workflow on the customer site by using pre-developed IRIS components

The solution is based on the following products: 

**InterSystems IRIS / HealthShare Health Connect** is a complete data platform that makes building and deploying high-performance applications
that connect medical data easier. InterSystems IRIS provides several libraries implementing the most popular medical standards – HL7 v2, HL7 FHIR, HL7, EDI, X12, and others. 
InterSystems IRIS provides a high-performant and secured data storage for each type of medical message and medical document. 
Finally, true medical data interoperability is provided by the IRIS standard library.

**FUME** is an FHIR conversion and transformation engine that enables data analysts to express FHIR-related data conversions in an easy, 
compact, and expressive syntax. FUME allows you to focus on what you want to achieve rather than the technical details of how 
you will achieve it - so you can get quality outcomes in a fraction of the time it takes with other tools, 
and most importantly - without requiring any programming knowledge or experience.
