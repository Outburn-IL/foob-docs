# Installing Intersystems FUME Plugin

The FUME Plugin installation is possible using ZPM (IPM) package manager.

The installer supports different platforms and workflow scenarios and can be adapted to new and existing IRIS implementations. Supported scenarios are:
 -  Existing IRIS or HealthShare Health Connect with FHIR Repository
 -  Existing IRIS or HealthShare Health Connect  without FHIR Repository when FHIR Repository is intended to be deployed as a part of the IRIS platform. 
 -  Existing IRIS or HealthShare Health Connect with 3rd party FHIR Server
 -  New IRIS or HealthShare Health Connect installation

If ZPM is not installed on your server yet, install it according to the instructions on the official [IRIS ZPM (IPM) package manager page](https://github.com/intersystems/ipm).

> Prerequisites:
1. The Outburn FUME Conversion engine is installed on the server accessible by IRIS, and the FUME Rest API is exposed.
2. ZPM is installed on the target IRIS server.
3. Target namespace and database were created (if required)
   
> Installation procedure:
1.	Open InterSystems IRIS for Health terminal
2.	Authenticate yourself using your credentials
3. switch the namespace to the target one where FUME Plugin will be installed
```shell
%SYS> zn "FUME"
FUME>
```

5. Launch ZPM:
```shell
FUME> zpm
```

6. On the next step, you have switch ZPM to use the Outburn package repository:

```shell
zpm:FUME> repo -r -n registry -url http://ec2-3-124-79-139.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:52773/registry/ -user **** -pass ****
```

7.	Next, execute the following command:

```shell
zpm:FUME> install -dev iris-fume-plugin
```

8.	Follow the installation instructions to complete the installation process

9.	When the installation is complete, check if it was successful:
- Check if a production with the name `Outburn.FumeNativeProduction.FumeProduction` exists. You should see the following:

- Check if a CSP application at URL `http://<iris_host>:<iris_port>/csp/healthshare/fume` is available
  
- By default, IRIS FUME plugin business service listens TCP port `9980`. Be sure to check if this port is opened. If not, please modify firewall settings (using your OS shell):
```shell
$ sudo ufw allow 9980
```

10.	Finally, donâ€™t forget switch ZPM back to the community repository:

```shell
zpm:FUME> repo -r -n registry -reset-defaults
```
Package uninstallation can be done using  the following command:  
```shell
zpm:FUME: uninstall iris-fume-plugin
```
