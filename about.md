# About Intersystems FUME Plugin

**Intersystems FUME Plugin** is a comprehensive solution, enabling InterSystems's IRIS and HealthShare Health Connect seamless integration capabilities with FUME, a powerful FHIR Converter by Outburn. The solution can efficiently convert JSON, HL7v2, and  CSV source messages to FHIR®, facilitating healthcare interoperability. 

The solution is based on the following products: 

**InterSystems IRIS / HealthShare Health Connect** is a complete data platform that makes building and deploying high-performance applications
that connect medical data easier. InterSystems IRIS provides several libraries implementing the most popular medical standards – HL7 v2, HL7 FHIR, HL7, EDI, X12, and others. 
InterSystems IRIS provides high-performing and secured data storage for each type of medical message and document. 
Finally, true medical data interoperability is provided by the IRIS standard library.

**FUME** is an FHIR conversion and transformation engine that enables data analysts to express FHIR-related data conversions in an easy, 
compact, and expressive syntax. FUME allows you to focus on what you want to achieve rather than the technical details of how 
you will achieve it - so you can get quality outcomes in a fraction of the time it takes with other tools, 
and most importantly - without requiring any programming knowledge or experience.

**FHIR Server** is a software application that implements the FHIR specification. It provides functionalities to interact with healthcare data using FHIR resources. This includes capabilities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) healthcare data resources. FHIR servers often support interactions through standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and utilize FHIR-defined operations. The InterSystems FHIR plugin supports the Internal FHIR repository and External FHIR Server.

> The following aspects were taken into account during the solution design:

*Functionality:*  The solution supports various data types conversion to FHIR using pre-defined IRIS classes seamlessly integrated with FUME. The IRIS developer/integrator can build and adapt default solutions to the target workflow according to the business requirements. The solution 

*Simplicity:* Minimum Object Script coding needs by developing integration-ready components. 

*Flexibility:* The solution can quickly adapt to any S2T workflow on the customer site using pre-developed IRIS components and readiness for
