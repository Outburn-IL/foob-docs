# About FHIR Out Of The Box

FHIR® Out-of-the-Box is a comprehensive solution combining InterSystems's IRIS and  HealthShare Health Connect integration capabilities with FUME, a powerful FHIR® Converter by Outburn LTD. The solution provides the capability for efficiently transforming messages between HL7v2, CSV, and FHIR®, facilitating healthcare interoperability.  

The solution is comprised of the following components: 

**InterSystems IRIS** is a complete data platform that makes building and deploying high-performance applications
that connect medical data easier. InterSystems IRIS provides several libraries implementing the most popular medical standards – HL7 v2, HL7 FHIR, HL7, EDI, X12, and others. 
InterSystems IRIS provides a high-performant and secured data storage for each type of medical message and medical document. 
Finally, true medical data interoperability is provided by the IRIS standard library.

**FUME** is an FHIR conversion and transformation engine that enables data analysts to express FHIR-related data conversions in an easy, 
compact, and expressive syntax. FUME allows you to focus on what you want to achieve rather than the technical details of how 
you will achieve it - so you can get quality outcomes in a fraction of the time it takes with other tools, 
and most importantly - without requiring any programming knowledge or experience.
